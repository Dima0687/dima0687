#### Currently i'm looking for a job as a `myBioInformation["lookingForAJobAs"]`. I do not have preferences about front or backend. 

What do i need to work well?

1. The team must be right
2. I must have the opportunity to develop myself further, to expand my knowledge and to be able to use all of this again in the company.
3. The salary must be right, because I have a family to support.
